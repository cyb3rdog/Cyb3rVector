# Welcome to Cyb3rVector's CodeLab Project

The ultimate goal of this Project is to finish this educational application to enable anyone to use the **Vector's SDK** even without technical background or programming skills.
Main instrument to achieve this goal is called **Vector's CodeLab** - a Blockly based coding enviroment which allows executing various commands through creating a simple programs by stacking graphical blocks together.
This **CodeLab enviroment** and **Vector Robot** combined creates an ideal platform for young to develop variety of their skills and their love towards technology and robotics.
I want this software to be available to anyone for free of charge, as I believe the education should be fun, playful and free.
