This document describes the goals of the Cyb3rVector project
- All completed road map milestones are marked with: ✔️
- Unfinished road map milestones are marked with:   🏁

## Phase I. - Cyb3rVector

The ultimate goal of this Project is to finish this educational Application to enable people to use the **Vector's SDK** even without the technical background or programming skills.
Main instrument to achieve this goal is called **Vector's CodeLab** - Blockly based coding enviroment which allows executing various commands through creating a simple programs by stacking blocks together.
The application is designed to be intuitive, simple enough, fun and educational, allowing everyone to develop their technical and coding skills, through pure enjoyment of the Play with the Vector robot.

## Phase II. - Cyb3rVector's Online Codelab

Main Goal of this phase is to Port the CodeLab to platform independent Web environment hosted on own servers and Create tools for people to connect their Vectors to this Web Site.

- ✔️ Proof of concept tests and trials
- 🏁 ***Vector SDK/API adjusment***
- 🏁 ***Server backend interpretter for existing Vector blocks***
- 🏁 ***Server site CodeLab Enviroment***

- 🏁 ***Client Proxy applications with Vector connection configurator***
- 🏁 ***Client Proxy Builds for Windows, Mac, Linux***
- 🏁 ***Client Proxy apps Built for Android and Iphone***


## Phase III. - Cyb3rVector's Codelab Software

This stage will focus on creating a specific version of Vector's CodeLab which will be hosted directly from Vector, allowing the users to login to Vector's CodeLab hosted on Vector's software from any device in the local network.

- 🏁 ***Obtaining OSKR***
- 🏁 ***Creating CodeLab port to run directly from Vector***
- 🏁 ***Deploying the CodeLab port to OSKR Software***
- 🏁 ***Extending the Software and CodeLab capabilities***


## Just a word before you go...

As you can see, there is still plenty of work ahead and I doubt I will make it to the finish line without your help and support.
I am working on this project in my free time, over the evenings, nights and weekends, and I am not being payed for doing so in any ways.
So if you want to help, you're very welcome to support this project by donating, or by joining me in testing and translating.

Sincere Thanks!

Gratefully yours,
Cyb3rdog
