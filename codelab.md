## Welcome to Cyb3rVector's Online Codelab Demo

This is an online showcase of the Blocks from the latest build of the **Cyb3rVector's CodeLab** application.
<span style="color: #ffbf00;">Blocks related to Vector robot will NOT be functional here, because this CodeLab and your Browser isn't connected to any Vector robot.</span>
As stated in [**ROAD MAP**](https://cyb3rdog.github.io/Cyb3rVector) ***Phase II.*** will have to be finished first in order to provide you with that online functionality.

However:
- You can take a look what blocks you will find in the application itself.
- Try out the special fields like date, time, sliders, angles, and advanced mode switch.
- You can even try the interpetation and execution of the standard blocks
- And you can download the latest version of Cyb3rVector and give it a go for real: {download}
